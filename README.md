## A little backstory about my love for programming ##

I'm a gamer by heritage. My dad and my mom are gamers, and my dad had a passion for working with electronics and building circuits, which sparked my early exposure to the world of technology. In my childhood, I discovered a game called "Minecraft," which sparked my creativity and curiosity. I learned the basics of programming by modifying the .jar files in older Minecraft versions to add mods. This hands-on experience taught me fundamental concepts like file manipulation, logic, and problem-solving, while also giving me a sense of accomplishment when I successfully customized the game. It was through this process that I realized programming could be both fun and empowering!

## About me and my abilities ##

I am curious by nature, I love to learn, to interact with people, and to create! And i'm a very good listener

Today i am a student developer and i am learning front-end and back-end technologies, with desires of learning Java, Python and C#. As a strongly self-taught person, i have always prioritized learrning. Even if i don't use that information that i've learned, at least the path of learning it made me more capable, and maybe i can use it as a hobby!

My biggest dream is to work with great minds, to grow not only as a person, but as a part of a society that builds and drives our wolrd with innovation and information.

If you liked my introduction, feel free to give me an feedback on any of my projects! Just remember: Be polite!
