## A little backstory about my love for programming ##

I'm a gamer by heirloom, my dad and my mom are gamers, and my dad loved electronics and circuitry making, so i've always been in this world. In my childhood i have discovered a game called "Minecraft". I've also learned the world of mods because of it, and in the early days of Minecraft, to put mods in it, you had to open the .jar file and insert them there. I used to open it with WinRAR and inject the mods on the game, even knowing that might breaak the game. I've entered the Minecraft Modding community and dreamed to one day make my own mods for the game, and that's how my love for programming blossomed!

I am curious by nature, i love to learn, to interact with people, and to create! And a very good listener!!  

Today i am a student developer and i am learning front and back-end, with desires of learning Java, Python and C#. As a strongly self-taught person, i have always prioritized learrning. Even if i don't use that information that i've learned, at least the path of learning it made me more capable, and maybe i can use it as a hobby!

My biggest dream is to work with great minds, to grow not only as a person, but as a part of a society that builds and moves our wolrd with innovation and information.

If you liked my introduction, feel free to give me an feedback on any of my projects! Just remember: Be polite!
