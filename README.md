## A little backstory about my love for programming ##

I'm a gamer by heritage. Both my dad and my mom are gamers, and my dad had a passion for working with electronics and building circuits, which sparked my early exposure to the world of technology. In my childhood, I discovered a game called "Minecraft" and its modding community, which sparked my creativity and curiosity. I learned the basics of programming by modifying the .jar files in older Minecraft versions to add mods. This hands-on experience taught me fundamental concepts like file manipulation, logic, and problem-solving, while also giving me a sense of accomplishment when I successfully customized the game. It was through this process that I realized programming could be both fun and empowering!

## About me and my abilities ##

I am curious by nature. I love to learn, to interact with people, and to create! I'm also a very good listener.

Today, I am a student developer learning front-end and back-end technologies, with a desire to learn Java, Python, and C#. As a strongly self-taught person, I have always prioritized learning. Even if i don't use that information that i've learned, at least the path of learning it made me more capable, and maybe i can use it as a hobby!

My biggest dream is to work with great minds and grow not only as a person but also as part of a society that builds and drives our world with innovation and information.

 If you liked my introduction, feel free to give me feedback on any of my projects! Just remember to be polite!
